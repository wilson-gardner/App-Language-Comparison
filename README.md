# App-Language-Comparison
This is a Car Dealership application that tracks inventory and vehicle information coded in several different programming languages to both demonstrate my ability to write and understand each language and also illustrate the similarities and differences of each.the 

NOTE: Each language was coded at a different time and therefore show slight differences in the approach that was taken. I will try to make them as similar in architecture as possible down the road to better showcase their similarities and differences.

Thanks for checking this out!
